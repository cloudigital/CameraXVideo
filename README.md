# CameraXVideo

CameraX Video Recording demo in Kotlin

What it does:

1. Record video using CameraX. When the camera starts, it immediately starts recording and stops recording after a pre-defined duration.
2. Start camera preview using CameraX and read barcodes using ZXing or Dynamsoft Barcode Reader and test the reading performance.
3. Use FFMpeg to grab frames and read barcodes from them.
4. Use a VideoView to play the video and then use PixelCopy to make snapshots for reading barcodes.
5. The results can be visualized using WebView+echarts.
